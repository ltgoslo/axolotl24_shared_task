# AXOLOTL - Finnish, Russian and German test datasets

This directory contain the Finnish and Russian test data for the AXOLOTL shared task. 

The German test data `axolotl.test.surprise.tsv` are derived from the DWUG DE Sense dataset and can be downloaded from its [webpage](https://zenodo.org/records/12628143). Please cite this data as specified on that webpage.

**The deadline for submitting predictions is April 9, 2024**

The data format is the same as in the [training and development sets](https://github.com/ltgoslo/axolotl24_shared_task/tree/main/data),
but the `sense_id` and `gloss` fields are empty for the usages from the `new` time period.
The task of the participants is to fill in these values (senses for Subtask 1 and definitions for the novel senses for Subtask 2).

- **[Codalab competition for Subtask 2](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/18008)**

Please strictly follow the correct format of predictions: both for [Subtask 1](https://github.com/ltgoslo/axolotl24_shared_task/blob/main/data/sample_predictions_track1.tsv) and for [Subtask 2](https://github.com/ltgoslo/axolotl24_shared_task/blob/main/data/sample_predictions_track2.tsv).
